I encountered 2 issues, with vite federation and with mf-cra, which took most of my time, if I had more time I would:<br />
Convert to typescript and use a monorepo properly for type/util sharing.<br />
Write some unit tests.<br />
Try to make the layout more responsive and the design more slick.<br />
